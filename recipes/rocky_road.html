    <div id="portion">16 squares</div>
    <div id="prep-time">15 mins</div>
    <div id="ingredients">
        100g butter, cubed
        300g chocolate, broken into pieces
        3tbsp golden syrup
        135g rich tea biscuits, broken into pieces
        1 handful mini marshmallows
        140g chocolate bars, chopped
    </div>
    <div id="instructions">
        Put the butter, chocolate and syrup in a pan over a low heat. Melt them together, stirring until smooth. Cool for about 10 mins.
        Line a 17cm square tin with foil - or any tin you have about that size. Stir the biscuits and sweets into the chocolate until they are all covered. Pour and spoon the mixture into the tin (don't eat too much as you do it!), and spread the mixture out.
        Put in the fridge until hard, then cut into squares or fingers.
